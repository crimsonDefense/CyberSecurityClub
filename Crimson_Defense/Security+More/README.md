# Security+ More

If you are interested in getting a Security+ certification, you have come to the right place. Here you will find links to resources that will help you get prepared for this challenging but ever so rewarding task. Getting a certification while still in school not only shows that you know what you claim to know but it shows that you are someone that goes above and beyond the normal expectations. You are someone who is excited and eager to learn. <br>

Security+ is not the only certification you can get, but it is a great place to start. Not all companies care about what certifications you have, but many do and use it as an added evaluation metric during the interview process. <br>

## Resources
For those of you ready to get going and want the good stuff, here you go. Former Crimson Defense president Jake Wachs created a public drive full of resources to help you learn more about really anything. There are so many resources here, I recommend you bookmark it to your bookmarks toolbar! Now how he came about all of these great resources, I do not know. I would honestly rather it be a mystery then finding out that he just googled it. Here you will not only find resources to help you prepare for the Security+ exam but with anything that involves cyber security. Interested in learning about malware, cryptography, network security, cryptography AND network security, Kali Linux, or advanced penetration testing? Then you should definitely check this out. You will also find that one of our current officers, Zachary Weske, has made some contributions as well. So you also have him to thank, and possibly others.<br>

If you instantly fall in love with Professor Messer like most of us have, here is a link to his website where you can buy material to get you ready for the certification you are interested in getting. It's great stuff and worth the buy if you are willing to put in the time and really prepare for the exam. Buying it doesn't gaurantee that you will pass, it is up to you to put in the hard work. But hey, I believe in you!<br>
